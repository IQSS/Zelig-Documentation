\section{Introduction}

The range of allowable formula in Zelig is often over-articulate. This allows
end-users and developers a wide-range of syntactically legal formula options.

The following document defines the specification for models to be submitted to
Zelig.

\section{Conceptual Requirements}
\label{Conceptual-Requirements}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Formal language for describing statistical models. The language used to
    articulate the models should be written generally enough to articulate 
    arbitrary statistical models. In particular, Zelig needs specifications to
    provide details for implementing models containing variable types:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Continuous,
      \item Ordered and
      \item Multinomial
    \end{itemize}

    As well as providing facilities for articulating multivariate regressions.

  \item 
\end{enumerate}


\section{Basic Formula}

The basic structure of a Zelig formula conforms to the following specifications:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The left-hand side must be written in one of two formats:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item It must evaluate to a singular vector, or
      \item It must evaluate to a matrix with one column per outcome variable.
    \end{itemize}
  \item The left-hand side of the formula specifies the outcome (dependent) variables.
  \item The formula must be flat. That is, nested formula are considered
    illegal. For example, the formula {\tt y ~ a ~ b} is considered illegal.
  \item The left-hand side only supports "+", "*". ":", and "cbind",
  \item "cbind" can only be used as the first operation on the left-hand side of an equation.
  \item The right-hand side of the formula specifies the explanatory (independent) variables.
  \item The formula may be a list if it is describing multiple outcome variables.
\end{enumerate}
